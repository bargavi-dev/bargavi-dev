  

  My name is Bargavi and presently finishing my last month at Digital Crafts, a full-stack coding bootcamp based out of Houston, Texas. Originally a English as a Second Language Teacher in South Korea, I eventually stumbled upon a Free Code Camp chapter in Seoul and my interest in coding grew from there. I'm an enthusiatic learner and enjoy collaborating with others-please feel free to reach out if you're interested in connecting! 



- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js. 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and projects relating to the fight against human trafficking and cyber crime.


-  🙋🏽‍♀️ Pronouns: She/Her

- 💃🏽 Fun fact: I enjoy salsa-dancing and going to improv shows.
