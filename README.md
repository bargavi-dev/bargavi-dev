Originally a English as a Second Language Teacher in South Korea, I eventually stumbled upon a Free Code Camp chapter in Seoul and my interest in coding grew from there. I'm an enthusiatic learner and enjoy collaborating with others-please feel free to reach out if you're interested in connecting!<br>
